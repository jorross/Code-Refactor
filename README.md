# Code Refactor
## Description
This was an exercise on my ability to take a working codebase and, without altering the functionality or design, change the html and CSS to be semantic and fill in missing gaps.
## Installation and Usage
All that is required for this exercise to work is an IDE and a working browser. Clone this repository, host it in github pages, and see how it works!
